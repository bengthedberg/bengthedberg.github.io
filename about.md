I am a software developer with a *few* years experience in this industry, being fortunate to have witness some of the changes this industry has experienced. 

> But for me there is neither Monday nor Sunday: there are days which pass in disorder, and then, sudden lightning like this one. Nothing has changed and yet everything is different. I can't describe it, it's like the Nausea and yet it's just the opposite:  at last an adventure happens to me and when I question myself I see that it happens that I am myself and that I am here; I am the one who splits in the night, I am as happy as the hero of a novel.”  
> **Jean-Paul Sartre**

When you discover and understand something, maybe in an area you been working in for a while, that puts everything in a new light. The excitement and enjoyment that finally,  *this* will change everything. 

In the end, software is developed to improve peoples life and the world around us.
